        "paragraph": "We hope to create a digital space where successful and less than successful experiences on developing humanitarian projects and products can be shared across Jesuit’s engineering schools worldwide. Our goal is to facilitate the inspiration, collaboration, promotion, divulgation and support of humanitarian projects across Jesuit’s engineering schools to improve their impact and scope. Our vision is of a global and unified group of Jesuit engineering schools working together towards a common goal: to design and implement humanitarian products with the capability of changing lives of the communities we work with through projects that promote a human centric design and frugal innovation approach.Our proposal looks to tap into these advantages not only in order to learn about technologies developed in partnered engineering schools, but also to learn about techniques and methods on how to better approach our target population, to really understand their needs and design for those needs by utilizing techniques such as the Frugal Innovation approach."
